IRC Client Daemon BREAKS
========================

This is the list of changes that breaks compatibility.

Between 1.0 and 1.1
-------------------

Deprecations:

* The functions plugin.getHome() and plugin.getName() are deprecated. Use
  plugin.info().home and plugin.info().name.
* The option [general] plugins is deprecated, users must switch to [plugins]
  dedicated section.
* Some functions from irccd.util were moved through irccd.system and irccd.fs.

Breaks:

* The functions server:whois() and server:names() trigger new callbacks
  onWhois and onNames instead of calling deferred functions.
* Plugins should not call any Lua irccd function outside callbacks.
  Use onLoad and onUnload.

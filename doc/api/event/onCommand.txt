name: onCommand
---

Special commands are not real IRC events. They are called from channel messages with a specific syntax using a delimiter and the plugin name.

For instance, with default irccd parameters, saying on a channel <code>!ask foo</code> will call the special command of the plugin named *ask*, so from the file <code>ask.lua</code>.

Note that the command character is not fixed to '!', it's just the default and can be set by the parameter command-char in a [[User_guide#The-section-server|server]] section.

# SYNOPSIS

````lua
function onCommand(server, channel, who, message)
````

# ARGUMENTS

- server, the current server.
- channel, the channel where the message comes from.
- who, who invoked the command.
- message, the real message, without the "!" part.

event: onReload
---

This function is called when irccd instance reload a plugin. Thus, there are no IRC events that call this function.

This function does nothing in the irccd internals, it just calls a function that you can use to reload some data. It does not delete anything.

If you want to fully unload a plugin, use `irccdctl unload` then `irccdctl load`.

# Usage

Bring filesystem functions.

Because Lua does not offer filesystem functions, this portable module provides
some functions for reading and creating directories.

# Functions

- [basename](function/basename.html)
- [dirname](function/dirname.html)
- [exists](function/exists.html)
- [mkdir](function/mkdir.html)
- [opendir](function/opendir.html)

# Types

- [Directory](type/Directory/index.html)

method: select
---

Select a socket ready for input. If both seconds and microseconds are set to 0 (which is the default), the listener waits indefinitely.

+Warning+: the return value is a new allocated socket, it has a different userdata pointer so you should not use this address as a reference to a specific client. Instead, you may compare the socket by using it's equals metamethod. This may change in the future.

module: irccd.logger
summary: "Logging functions"
---

# Usage

You should use this module instead of Lua's print function because irccd may
redirect output to a specific file depending on the user's configuration.

For instance, if user has chosen to log into syslog, this module will log at syslog too.

# Functions

- [log](function/log.html)
- [warn](function/warn.html)

# Usage

You should use this module instead of Lua's print function because irccd may redirect output to a specific file depending on the user's configuration. For instance, if user has chosen to log into syslog, this module will log at syslog too.

| Function          | Description    |
|-------------------|----------------|
| [log](log.html)   | Log a message  |
| [warn](warn.html) | Warn a message |

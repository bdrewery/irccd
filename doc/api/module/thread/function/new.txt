function: new

Create a new thread. Use the function as the thread function. You can pass any parameter you like to the thread just after the function itself.

+Note+: userdata and functions are not supported as parameters.

You may discard the return value, the thread will automatically be deleted when its execution has finished but it's not recommended.

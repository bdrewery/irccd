Real thread management.

Thread are a very different thing than Lua's coroutines. They are real threads which are completely detached from the host script. Because of the nature of Lua, threads are also executed in a separate Lua's context. That is, if you need to pass data betweens threads, you must use the dedicated [[api-irccd-thread-pipe|pipe]] API.

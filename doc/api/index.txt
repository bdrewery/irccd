## Irccd additions to JavaScript

As you may know, JavaScript 5 does not come with any function to load modules
from external files.

Because irccd split the JavaScript API as modules, the user must explicitly load
them when needed.

There are two ways for that purpose.

### using function

The `using` function allows loading an irccd module and to set all symbols from
that module as global.

This is similar to the `using namespace ns` statement in C++ where ns is the
module name.

**Example with irccd.filesystem**:

The `irccd.fs` modules define two functions `File` and `Directory` and other
symbols, when calling using like this:

````javascript
using("irccd.fs")
````

You'll be able to use `File` and `Directory` functions directly from global
namespace like this:

````javascript
var f = new File();
````

**Note**: the `using` function does not support loading modules from external
files.

### require function

In contrast with the `using` function, the `require` function loads a module
which can be both a irccd module or a file.

The `require` function returns an object containing all symbols exported
from the module.

**Example with irccd.filesystem**:

You can use `require` like this:

````javascript
var fs = require("irccd.fs")
var f = new fs.File();
````

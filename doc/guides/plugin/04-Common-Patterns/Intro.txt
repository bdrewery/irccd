# Common patterns

Some plugins can be configured, and some of them can use patterns to substitute
variables.

For instance, using the **logger** plugin, it's possible to customize the
pattern to use when someone joins a channel like that:

````
#U joined #c
````

The keywords **#U** will be substituted to the nickname and **#c** to the
channel name.

**Note**: some keywords are obviously not available for all contexts. When
plugins supports these patterns, they are marked as
**Keywords supported: #c, #m**.

**Warning**: common patterns are just a concept, the plugin is free to use
different things.

## Environment variables

If supported, you can use environment variables like **${HOME}**. Please note
that braces are mandatory.

## Time

When you can use patterns, the date and time may be used just like `strftime(3)`
so for the hours and minutes, you can use **%H:%M**.

## Home

To match your user directory, you can use the famous **~**.

## List of keywords supported

Here's the list of keywords that a lot of plugins uses:

- **#c**, the channel name
- **#m**, a message (depending on context)
- **#s**, the current server name
- **#t**, the topic
- **#T**, a target, i.e a person who gets kicked
- **#u**, the full user, i.e `markand!~mkd@localhost`
- **#U**, the nickname

**Example with logger**

Using the plugin logger, you can use a configuration like this:

````ini
[general]
directory = "~/logs/#s/%y/%m/#c-%d.log"

[formats]
message  = "%H:%M #u: #m"
````

With this example, ~ will be substituted to the user home directory. With a server
named **local**, a channel *#staff* everything would be stored like this:

**/home/markand/local/13/07/#staff-08.log**

Also the message would be stored like this:

**20:50 markand: I'm watching TV.**

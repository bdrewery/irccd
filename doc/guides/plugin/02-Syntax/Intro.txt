# Syntax

In this paragraph, you will learn the basic [Lua](http://lua.org) syntax.

## Why Lua?

Lua is a very fast, light and extensible language. It has been proven and widely
used in the game industry. Lua also offers a very great sandboxing system to
avoid script to alter or even worse, to destroy the system.

This is possible because individual parts of Lua can be enabled or disabled in
the host application. For instance, irccd disable the `os` Lua module because
it has unsafe functions such as
[os.execute](http://www.lua.org/manual/5.2/manual.html#pdf-os.execute) or simply
[os.exit](http://www.lua.org/manual/5.2/manual.html#pdf-os.exit) which will
abort the daemon.

Lua also have a clean syntax, consider the following:

````lua
local info = {
    host   = "localhost",
    port   = 9960,
    ssl    = true
}
````

This create a new table value which is the most powerful data type in Lua, its
syntax is so clean that it is sometimes used as application configuration files.

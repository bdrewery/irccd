== Introduction

The plugin `history` is used to check when someone has been seen for the last
time on a channel. For that purpose, irccd needs to be on that channel forever
if possible.

== Installation

The plugin `history` is distributed with `irccd`. To enable it add the following
to your `plugins` parameter:

----
plugins = "history"
----

== Usage

The plugin `history` only reacts to the special command. It understands `seen`
and `said` sub commands.

The sub command seen tells you when the user has been seen for the last time.

The sub command said tells you what the user has said for the last time.

.Example
----
markand: !history seen jean
irccd: markand, the last time I've seen jean was on 18/01/1989 at 20:55
markand: !history said jean
irccd: markand, the last thing that jean said was: hello world
----

See link:user-guide.html#irccdplugnote[irccd plugin notes].

== Configuration

The plugin `history` can be configured in the file `history.conf`. You can change
the answers from irccd.

The `history.conf` uses link:user-guide.html#irccdsyntax[irccd syntax].

=== Section `formats`

This section configures the answers that irccd will uses to answers requests.

.Option `error`

When the plugin history could not open the database files, it uses this option
to respond an error.

.Option `seen`

This option is used for the command `!history seen`.

[formats]
error = "An error occured"
seen = "I've seen #U on #c the %m/%d/%y at %H:%M"
said = "#U on #c said the %m/%d/%y at %H:%M: #m"
unknown = "who's #U??"

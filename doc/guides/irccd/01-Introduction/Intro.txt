# Introduction

Irccd is a IRC bot written in [C++14](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B14) and [Lua](http://www.lua.org).

It is developed in mind of being as portable as possible.

Irccd also tries to be small and efficient. It is not uncommon to see more than
twenty plugins loaded without eating all your memory.

Irccd also tries to have the best API for writing the funniest plugins ever.

## History

At the beginning, irccd was initially created to teach me advanced C++11 and Lua
integration.

In less than two months starting from its initial creation, irccd was already
able to load multiple plugins, connect to multiple servers and such.

Quickly, a clean but powerful API was added in order to create funny scripts.

Now the API has grown almost by two times and let you create independant
plugins which continue running even if there are no events.

## Features

- Use Lua plugin to catch IRC events,
- Support multiple,
- Support multiple identities,
- Can be controled by sockets,
- Run on Linux, Windows and *BSD,
- Well documented,
- Clean and powerful Lua API,
- Very fast and light.

	http://projects.malikania.fr/irccd/doc/guides/user-guide.html

Requirements
============

* C++11 compiler, you need a compiler that support C++11. For Windows,
  Visual Studio 2012 or superior is known to work. On Unix, clang 3.2 or
  superior also work.

* libircclient (http://www.ulduzsoft.com/linux/libircclient). This library
  is mandatory. You need version 1.7 or superior to get SSL support.

* cmake (http://www.cmake.org). This tool is needed to build irccd.

Optional:

* Lua 5.2 or higher (http://lua.org). This library is needed in order to use
  irccd plugins.

Developer requirements
======================

If you plan to develop irccd to add new feature or to fix something, some of
there tools and libraries may help you.

* asciidoc (http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/). This is used as the user
  guide generator.

  When found, CMake automatically generate a new target `generate-doc' that
  automatically update user guides directly in the doc/guides.

* LDoc (https://github.com/stevedonovan/LDoc). This tool is used to create the
  Lua API.

  When found, CMake automatically generate a new target `generate-ldoc' that
  automatically update Lua API HTML file in doc/ldoc/lua.

* cppunit (http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/cppunit/). This tool is used
  for unit tests in tests/ directory.

  Note: currently there are no tests for this release. It will be added in 1.1.

Basic installation
==================

This is the quick way to install irccd.

$ tar xvzf irccd-x.y.tar.gz
$ cd irccd-x.y
$ mkdir _build_
$ cd _build_
$ cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
$ make
# make install

Do not forget to adapt x.y with the current version.

Tweaking installation
=====================

If you want to disable or change some component, you need to adjust one of
the following CMake variable.

Disabling Lua
-------------

If you want to build irccd without Lua, use this CMake argument:

$ cmake .. -DWITH_LUA=Off

Disabling Lua documentation
---------------------------

If you don't want Lua API documentation, use this:

$ cmake .. -DWITH_LDOC=Off

Disabling user guides
---------------------

This switch disable HTMl user guides.

$ cmake .. -DWITH_DOC=Off

Disabling manuals
-----------------

This disable manual pages, it's already the default on Windows.

$ cmake .. -WITH_MAN=Off

Directories
===========

It's also possible to set different directories for irccd components.

Adjusting the installation directory
------------------------------------

By default, irccd will usually use /usr/local as the prefix for
installation. To change this, use the following:

$ cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/new/directory

Manual directories
------------------

By default, irccd use ${PREFIX}/share/man for manual pages. Some systems use
different one.

For example, on FreeBSD the typical use would be:

$ cmake .. -DMANDIR=/usr/local/man
